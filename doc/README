	Easy...


KEYS WHILE RUNNING:

	F11 - Take a screenshot (filename is "xxx-#.gif", where 'xxx' is
		the short title, and '#' is an auto-incrementing number)

	F12 - Instant exit (if this doesn't work, pray)

	PrintScreen - Toggle showing of priority screen

	ScrollLock - Toggle showing of object information

	Pause - Toggle turbo mode


RUNNING:

	(The binary is created in the 'src' directory)

	The syntax is:

		lagii [-v] [-h] [-d <dump-file>] [-t] [-o] <game-dir>

	Where:

	-v	Print version information
	-h	Show help screen
	-d	Decompile LOGIC resources to <dump-file> as they are run
	-t	Turbo mode (quite silly)
	-o	Show object information
<game-dir>	Directiory holding AGI data files
